    <br>
    <p>Through this assemblage of work, I examine a "deep view" of media infrastructure across temporal and earthly scales beyond the colonialist desire to conquer the future, which manifests as projects of technological innovation.</p>
    <p>How can collective grief and healing practices help us re-relate with technology? How can we learn from queer, migrant, crip, and anti-colonial solidarity movements across the world to re-imagine networked infrastructure?</p>

            <p>In investigating the promises, technicalities, and cultural currents of blockchain, I found myself confronting the widespread neglect of the geopolitical realities undergirding technological innovation, as well as a troubling dependence on systems of machine prediction and organization to solve complex societal issues. </p>

                <p>There is power in the obscurity of infrastructure as widespread yet mundane as the Internet. I can’t trace every component that makes possible the delivery of a signal from my fingertips to yours, or the hungry churn of our signals combined. These smooth surfaces belie an eeriness not unlike standard winds through a monocropped field.</p>

                <p>All I know is the Metaverse is a place on Earth. Ursula K Le Guin debunks the dichotomy of high or low, defining technology as simply the active human interface with the material world. Jussi Parikka brings media into materiality to conceptualize “the wider geophysical life worlds that support organic life as much as the technological worlds of transmission, calculation, and storage.” Counter to what a culture obsessed with innovation and deliberately forgetful may suggest, everything that makes up this shiny sprawl has and always will exist. To ask where it comes from and where it will go is to reckon with unjust geopolitics.</p>

                <p>Under the grasp of technocapital realism, the only sensible task may be to un-world. To decompose systems of sterility into a vital mess. As Tiqqun asserts in The Cybernetic Hypothesis, we fight opacity with opacity. And what better subversion than the spacious, illegible, relational affordances of grief?</p>

                <p>If it’s geological, it’s grievable. Dilating the teachings of a Buddhist mother beyond samsaric hierarchies, I say ancestral work is simply the inquiry of relation. Grief is kinetic, a thread to pull on and watch all the parts unravel into ungovernable vulnerability. Ingredients to weave a resting place for the technological imaginary. Breath to expand our scope of concern. Supply chains, eroding into the possibility of some wounded kinship. Tears to conduct ions and eons alike – through them I see something beyond a future.</p>

                <p>This living library serves a place of respite, remembering, and strategy for those of us who are tired of being constantly mandated to get on board with a "future" drafted without our input or consent, yet who know in our bodies and spirits of technologies far wiser than products of Silicon Valley. Not meant to be a parking lot of critique against the current systems (though ofc we must stay aware), this space is instead dedicated to the many other possible cosmologies of infrastructure so that we can expand our cultural imagination and empower collective agency.</p>

                <p>In here you'll find readings, quotes, metaphors, memes, instructional manuals, spells, and recipes for bringing about alternative networks. Add your own resources - let's learn together!</p>

                <p><b>Walk the Web!</b> is an idea for a workshop and performance to unravel and reconfigure the Internet from a corporeal perspective. As the state of web is ushered into major shifts, how can we center our social and earthly needs rather than fall into deeper capitalist extraction? What does decentralization mean in context of local context, and how can a network take the shape of community?</p>

                <p>Rather than engage from a purely theoretical or logical approach with these questions, this project makes space for vulnerability and solidarity.</p>

                <p>The preparation of the performance would double as a process of hands-on learning and reflection, as participants literally unravel used digital infrastructure equipment to make into new communication costumes.</p>

                <p>Then wearing these, we embody a web in motion through an interactive public procession in the streets, to broadcast our concerns and demands for the future of the Internet.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p>As part of my guest lecture at HFBK, I facilitated a <b> grief ritual</b> to explore technological dependencies from a relational perspective. Together we sat in a circle around a simple altar comprising of water (as a foundational conductor of electricity), fire (as a reminder of caution around technology), and smoke (as a timeless sensory portal for the spirits).</p>

                <p>To call in “ancestors and ghosts”, we lit up our phones with photos of all that has “passed” in context of technology. The stories spanned antique Walkman's, locked social media identities, mining rigs, conflict minerals, and all the way back to creatures from the carboniferous era whose fossils now serve as a main source of electricity.</p>

                <p>Framing with grief offers a space for radical relationing beyond hegemonic Western norms. Grief invites humor and vulnerability as we unpack aspects of a dominant system that we don’t know, feel gratitude toward, or conflicted about. It’s also a good reminder that we can hold these tensions differently and at the same time.</p>

                What can technological infrastructure feel like if it were rooted in just relations with the Earth at every layer? Would cables spring up, shape-shift, and decompose as needed?

                <p>Drawing from Alexis Pauline Gumbs’ lessons on marine mammals and community organizing, we conducted rounds of <i>echolocation</i> by moving our bodies alongside each other while relaying signals in a public outdoors environment. The reflections that followed were surprisingly rich, as we navigated consent through the use of eye contact, and considered the non-neutrality of technology through the ways we vocalized sounds.</p>
